# Database Modeling

This repository stores SQL script that I wrote for my Data Management and SQL for Analytics class project. The database was created on Oracle with our team's group account, which is no longer active as of Summer 2020.

__Project Tasks:__
* Propose a database schema based on business needs.
  * [Final ERD](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17z1VVkzRwZQ0znuwEUJNwHtvgjsJZtkK/view?usp=sharing)
* Create tables and load data in Oracle database.
* Create views in Oracle and link Tableau to our database to create data visualizations to provide business solutions.
  * [Tableau Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/views/FreeTrainingSessions/Dashboard1?:language=en&:display_count=y&:origin=viz_share_link)
